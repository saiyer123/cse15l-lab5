# 1) 
Response from TA: Hello, try looking more into why the error message "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not find class [ArrayTests.java]" is appearing. It could be because of the `.java` at the end of the bash script.

# 2)
Thank you for the advice I was able to remove the `.java` and the tests were able to run successfully.

# Part 2 - Reflection
Something I found interesting that I learned in lab recently was about using VIM. I never knew about it and how you could acess it through
terminal. I found it cool how you could enter a specific mode and memorize all these shortcuts to view and edit code. The tutorial on terminal helped a lot with practice.
